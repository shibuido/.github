# 渋美道 shibuido

**The way of subtle, unobtrusive beauty in utility.**

## Philosophy

In the rich tradition of Japanese philosophy, we use "-do" (道, "the way") to denote a discipline or path:
- 柔道 judo — "the gentle way"
- 剣道 kendo — "the way of the sword"
- 茶道 sado — "the way of tea"

**Shibuido** (渋美道) combines:
- **渋** (shibu) — subtle, astringent, restrained elegance
- **美** (bi) — beauty
- **道** (do) — the way, path, discipline

It embodies the aesthetic principle of **shibui** (渋い) — a quiet, unobtrusive beauty that reveals itself over time through simplicity and function.

- **Wabi-Sabi** (侘寂) — Beauty in imperfection and transience
- **Ma** (間) — Intentional negative space

## What We Build

Small, focused tools that:
- Solve specific problems elegantly
- Work well with others
- Respect the user's time and attention
- Embrace simplicity over complexity

We organize our tools in:
- **Individual repositories** — Each tool stands alone
- **Collection repositories** — Curated sets via submodules for related tools

*Find beauty in utility. Find utility in beauty.*
